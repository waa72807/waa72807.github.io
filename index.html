<div style= "text-indent: 50px" 
<p> Todd Gurley was born on August 3, 1994 in Baltimore, Maryland. 
His family eventually moved to Tarboro, North Carolina where he attended Torboro Highschool. 
Gurley's junior year he ran for 1472 yards and 26 touchdowns. However, it was his senior year when it became 
obvious that he was truly a special player. In his senior season, Todd rushed for 2600 yards, 38 touchdowns, 
and led his team to win the 2A North Carolina state championship. All of these accomplishments were enough 
for him to be named the North Carolina Associated Press Player of the year. Many schools were interested in 
Gurley playing for them. For the longest time, he considered staying close to home and attending schools such 
as Clemson or UNC. After visiting Athens, he knew there was only one place that truly felt like home to him. 
On January 13, 2012, Todd commited to play college football at The University of Georgia. Because Gurley
was not even the most highly touted running back in his own recruited class at UGA, he was not
as hyped up by fans and coaches as others were. I believe this gave Todd the motivation that he needed
to not only earn himself a starting spot but to become one of the best players that Sanford Stadium
has ever seen. </p>
</div>
<h2 style="font-size: 20pt">Career at UGA </h2>
<div style= "text-indent: 50px">
<p> Gurley's first career game at Georgia was against Buffalo, and he showed the Bulldawg Nation that they 
had something to look forward to for the coming years. He rushed for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 
eight carries while also returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. He became only the second true
freshman in UGA history to rush for 1000 yards- the only other being Herschel Walker in UGA's national 
championship season and would be named All-SEC. Though Gurley's sophomore season was riddled with injuries,
he managed to put up good numbers. In 10 games (even some of these he was playing hurt), he managed 989 yards
on only 165 carries. This was still enough to earn him Second-Team All-SEC. Gurley's very impressive first
two years led him to be a front runner for the Heisman trophy leading into the 2014 college football season.
In only the first 5 games of the season, Todd ran for 773 yards. He was on the top of everyones Heisman
list. All of a sudden, something came out of nowhere that shocked all college football fans. Early in
the week before we played Vanderbilt, it was announced that Todd would be suspended and was under investigation
for accepting money for signing autographs and memorabilia. He would eventually miss 4 games before returning
against bitter rival Auburn. Towards the end of the fourth quarter, Gurley had trouble getting up after a run.
He had torn his ACL, which brought an end to his historic and inspring career at UGA. His junior year, he ran
for 911 yards in <b> less than 6 full games </b> He would declare for the NFL Draft following the 2014 season.
The following are his career stats at The University of Georgia.

<p> Todd no longer had to worry about selling his autograph for extra cash, as he was immediately
spondored by a big sports agency as well as recieving multiple major endorsement deals directly out of 
college. He was still undergoing rehab for his torn ACL, so many experts were unsure just how high
he would be selected in the draft. However, one organization knew exactly how talented he really was
and took a chance on him. Gurley was drafted by the St. Louis Rams as the 10th overall pick in first round 
of the 2015 NFL draft. This decision would not take long at all to pay off for the Rams. After missing
the first three games due to allowing his ACL fully recover, Todd had a historic rookie campaign. In his 
first full game back in nearly a year, Todd ran for 146 yards. He finished the season with 1106 rushing
yards and 10 touchdowns. He was voted the Offensive Rookie of the Year in the NFL for his incredible
performance. Todd is still only 22 years old and the sky is the limit for one of the best young talents
in the NFL. There is nothing that I look forward to more than watching him run the football in the
coming years. The following is <a href="http://www.therams.com/team/roster/Todd-Gurley/afd36d7d-cdf8-4fdf-88bf-eeacf244f78b">Todd Gurley's page for the Los Angeles Rams</a></p>
